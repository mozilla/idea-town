activitystreamMeasurements1 = We also collect basic information about your browser profile that affect Activity Stream, such as the number of bookmarks and history items.
activitystreamMeasurements2 = To provide Activity Stream, we fetch metadata about websites you have visited, such as images and icons, using a service called <a href="http://embed.ly/" target="_blank">Embedly</a>. We send these requests to Embedly through Mozilla's servers, so they will not be associated with you.

cliqzDescription = Get search results faster. Cliqz shows suggestions right below the URL bar as you type. All while maintaining your privacy.
cliqzIntroduction = Get search results faster, directly in the browser. Start typing and see suggestions from around the Web in real time, right below the URL bar. And because Cliqz avoids collecting personally identifiable data, or building user profiles, your results are more private.
cliqzPrivacypreamble = The Cliqz Test Pilot experiment is brought to you through collaboration between Cliqz GmbH, and Mozilla. Cliqz is designed to protect your privacy and avoid collecting sensitive information that can be used to create user profiles. However, anonymizing data like this is difficult, and it may still be possible to identify specific individuals.
cliqzMeasurements0 = Cliqz GmbH collects data about your search and browsing activity, including text as you type in the URL bar, queries you send to certain search engines, and data about your web page interactions, such as mouse movements, scrolls, and time spent.
cliqzMeasurements1 = Cliqz GmbH collects telemetry analytics, including your interactions with specific fields and buttons in Cliqz. This data is tied to a unique identifier allowing Cliqz GmbH to understand performance over time.

containersWarningFewerexperiments = Note: Because of the security properties of Containers, Test Pilot experiments such as Snooze Tabs may not work from within Container tabs. Remember, this is experimental technology!
containersIntroduction = Containers let you create profiles in Firefox for all of your online lives. Custom labels and color-coded tabs help keep different activities — like online shopping, travel planning, or checking work email — separate. Because Containers store cookies separately, you can log into the same site with a different account in each Container, and online trackers can’t connect your browsing in one container to another. So you can keep your shopping self separate from your social self from your work self, without worrying about being followed around the Web.
containersMeasurements0 = Containers will only send information to us when you interact with it, such as opening, editing, or deleting a container.
containersMeasurements1 = Containers will send information about the type of interaction with Containers, which Container you are interacting with, and the number of tabs in the Container.
