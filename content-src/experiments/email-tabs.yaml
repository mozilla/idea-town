  Easily create emails from all of your tabs and make saving and sharing easier than ever.
introduction: >
  <p>Ever needed to save or share a whole bunch of tabs as you research, shop, or just browse the web? Email Tabs lets you create beautiful emails from your open tabs to save them for later or share them. You can use Email Tabs to automatically send along links, screenshots, or even the text from articles.<p>
  <p>Email Tabs currently works with the Gmail webmail client, but we’re working to bring it to other popular webmail providers as well.</p>
