  <p>In addition to the <a href="/privacy">data</a> collected by all Test Pilot
    experiments, here are the key things you should know about what is happening
    when you use Universal Search:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>We collect basic usage data regarding how you interact with the Awesome
      Bar (address bar), such as the number of characters typed, the types of
      results that you click, and their position in the results list.</li>
    <li>If you previously configured Firefox to display search suggestions in
      the Search Bar, installing Universal Search will enable <a
      href="https://www.mozilla.org/privacy/firefox/#searchsuggestions"
      target="_blank">search suggestions</a> in the Awesome Bar.</li>
    <li>When you use the Awesome Bar, we send the terms you type to our
      recommendation engine. We keep anonymous logs of popular searches to
      improve the quality of our recommendations.</li>
    <li>To provide Universal Search, we use a few third-party services. We use
      <a href="http://www.bing.com/developers/s/APIBasics.html"
      target="_blank">Bing</a> and <a
      href="https://developer.yahoo.com/boss/search/" target="_blank">Yahoo</a>
      to provide recommendations, and <a href="http://docs.embed.ly/docs/"
      target="_blank">Embedly</a> and <a href="https://clearbit.com/logo"
      target="_blank">Clearbit</a> to provide additional data (such as images or
      icons) about those recommendations. To display the recommendations in the
      Awesome Bar, Universal Search may download those images directly from
      Embedly and Clearbit, which may allow those services to see your IP address
      and the image requested.</li>
