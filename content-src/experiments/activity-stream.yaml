  A rich visual history feed and a reimagined home page make it easier than ever
  to find exactly what you're looking for in Firefox.
introduction: >
  <p>Get back to browsing without losing your stream of thought. Activity Stream
    keeps your top sites, bookmarks and recent history close at hand in each new
    tab. And the new timeline view gives you a birds-eye view of your browsing.</p>

  <p>In addition to the <a href="/privacy">data</a> collected by all Test Pilot
    experiments, here are the key things you should know about what is happening
    when you use Activity Stream:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>We collect basic usage data regarding how you interact with experimental
      new tab and timeline pages, such as the types of elements that you click
      and their position on the page.</li>
    <li>We also collect basic information about your browser profile that affect
      Activity Stream, such as the number of bookmarks and history items.</li>
    <li>To provide Activity Stream, we fetch metadata about websites you have
      visited, such as images and icons, using a service called <a
      href="http://embed.ly/" target="_blank">Embedly</a>. We send these requests
      to Embedly through Mozilla's servers, so they will not be associated with
      you.</li>
  </ul>
