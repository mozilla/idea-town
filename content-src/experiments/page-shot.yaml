  <p>In addition to the <a href="/privacy">data</a> collected by all Test Pilot
    experiments, here are the key things you should know about what is happening
    when you use Page Shot:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>We store your shots on Mozilla's servers and will have access to those
      shots. However, we will only access your shots when reasonably necessary
      for the operation of the service, such as when someone sends us the link
      to a shot using our "flag" feature, or to diagnose any problems. We will
      also analyze all shots in the aggregate to help improve Page Shot, for
      example, by identifying the average size and number of shots taken by
      users.</li>
    <li>We collect usage data to help us understand your interactions with the
      product, such as the number of times you click the shots button, save an
      image, or encounter an error saving an image.</li>
    <li>To prevent abuse of this service, we do basic security monitoring. For
      example, we collect and retain IP addresses to detect and block individuals
      who are scanning the service to find private pages.</li>
    <li>For all visits to the Page Shot website, the data we collect is described
      in our <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/privacy/websites/"
      target="_blank">Websites, Communications & Cookies Privacy Notice</a>.</li>
