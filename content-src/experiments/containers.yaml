description: >
  Contain yourselves! Create different containers for each of your online lives -
  your work self, your social self, your personal self - to stay organized and maintain privacy.
warning: >
  Note: Because of the security properties of Containers, Test Pilot experiments such as Snooze Tabs may not work from within Container tabs. Remember, this is experimental technology!

introduction: >
  Containers let you create profiles in Firefox for all of your online lives. Custom
  labels and color-coded tabs help keep different activities — like online shopping,
  travel planning, or checking work email — separate.  Because Containers store cookies
  separately, you can log into the same site with a different account in each Container,
  and online trackers can’t connect your browsing in one container to another.  So you can
  keep your shopping self separate from your social self from your work self, without
  worrying about being followed around the Web.
