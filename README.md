# Test Pilot

Test Pilot is an opt-in platform that allows us to perform controlled tests of new high-visibility product concepts in the general release channel of Firefox.

Test Pilot is not intended to replace trains for most features, nor is it a test bed for concepts we do not believe have a strong chance of shipping in general release. Rather, it is reserved for features that require user feedback, testing, and tuning before they ship with the browser.
