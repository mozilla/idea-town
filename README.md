Test Pilot is an opt-in platform that allows us to perform controlled tests of new high-visibility product concepts in the general release channel of Firefox.

Test Pilot is not intended to replace trains for most features, nor is it a test bed for concepts we do not believe have a strong chance of shipping in general release. Rather, it is reserved for features that require user feedback, testing, and tuning before they ship with the browser.

## Repositories

## Development

### Quickstart

This project uses Docker in development. You'll get a lot of benefit
by acquainting yourself [with Docker and its documentation][docker-docs].
However, you can get started on Test Pilot development with a minimum of Docker
know-how:

[docker-docs]: https://docs.docker.com/

By default `js-lint` and `sass-lint` watch options are set to true. If you would like
to override these, you can do so in [debug-config.json](./debug-config.json).
if you'd like to run linters on `pre-commit` you can use this [pre-commit-hook](https://gist.github.com/meandavejustice/39f7edc046f3458aa076).

#### OS X hosts

1. [Install Docker Toolbox](http://docs.docker.com/mac/started/)

2. Make sure you have a default Docker machine:

  `docker-machine create -driver virtualbox default`

3. Make sure the default machine is running:

  `docker-machine start default`

4. Make sure your shell can see the default Docker machine:

  `eval "$(docker-machine env default)"`

5. Check the IP address of the default Docker machine:

  `docker-machine ip default`

6. Use this IP address to add an entry for `testpilot.dev` in `/etc/hosts`:

  `192.168.99.100 testpilot.dev`

  You can do this manually, or the [bin/update-ip.sh][update-ip] script can
  take care of this for you.

[update-ip]: https://github.com/mozilla/testpilot/blob/master/bin/update-ip.sh

7. Create and setup the Docker containers (this will take some time):

  `docker-compose up`

#### Ubuntu Linux hosts

1. [Install Docker](http://docs.docker.com/linux/started/)

2. [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

3. Add an entry for `testpilot.dev` in `/etc/hosts`:

  `127.0.0.1 testpilot.dev`

  You can do this manually, or the [bin/update-ip.sh][update-ip] script can
  take care of this for you.

4. Create and setup the Docker containers (this will take some time):

  `sudo docker-compose up`

#### Windows hosts

* **Help wanted**: Getting things working on Windows may be similar to OS X,
  but the team has little experience with that environment.

### Next Steps

* Start editing files - changes should be picked up automatically.

* Visit the Django server, using the hostname you added to `/etc/hosts`:

  `http://testpilot.dev:8000/`

* Visit Django admin, login with username `admin` and password `admin`:

  `http://testpilot.dev:8000/admin/`

    development, including how to set up custom configurations and run common
    tests & checks.

  * [`tox.ini`](./tox.ini) - to see what checks are run automatically in Travis
    CI, which you should ensure pass locally before submitting a Pull Request on
    GitHub

    site uses to enable advanced features.
