## Legacy Test Pilot

Hello there! Once upon a time, you installed an add-on called Test Pilot for Firefox.

Well the Test Pilot program for trying experimental features in Firefox is back, and we thought you might like to check it out.
The old add-on has been uninstalled for you. If you&apos;d like the new one, just click the [link](https://testpilot.firefox.com).

If you&apos;re not interested, simply close this tab and get back to browsing.

So that's Test Pilot. We're really happy you're here. Please check out our experiments and tell us what you think. If you have questions or would like to talk more, [you can find us on our forum](https://discourse.mozilla-community.org/c/test-pilot).

**Thanks for flying with us!**
