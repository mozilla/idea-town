# Test Pilot Deployment Verification Test Plan

## ENVIRONMENTS:

| ENVIRONMENT | URL |
|:------------|:----|
| Development | https://testpilot.dev.mozaws.net/
| Stage       | https://testpilot.stage.mozaws.net/
| Production  | https://testpilot.firefox.com/

## PREREQUISITES:

- Make sure your Developer Tools Console is open (for each browser), and verify that no unexpected messages (`console.log()`, CSP errors, SRI errors, etc) are logged to the console.

- Navigate to https://testpilot.firefox.com/__version__ (or desired environment) and verify the deployed Circle-CI build, commit SHA and version.

- Bonus points: Open your Browser Console (Firefox > Tools > Web Developer > Browser Console) and verify nothing odd is displayed from the Firefox firehose.

### Chrome <small>(ETA: 1m)</small>

1. Open Google Chrome.

1. Verify that you redirect to /experiments and that a toolbar icon and doorhanger appear to alert the user that the button has been placed in the toolbar.

1. Click the Test Pilot icon in the toolbar and verify the door-hanger appears and lists the available experiments (none of which should be enabled if you're testing on a clean profile).

1. Hover over each of the experiments (and View all experiments button) in the door-hanger from the previous step and verify the URLs have `?utm_` codes.

1. Click the **"Choose your features"** button on the main site, and verify that you're redirected to the https://testpilot.dev.mozaws.net/experiments page.

1. Go to **about:addons** in a new tab, switch to the Extensions section and look for the **Test Pilot** add-on. Verify that the Test Pilot spaceship icon appears in the list and click the **"Preferences"** button.

1. Click the **"Uninstall Test Pilot"** button in the drop down menu and confirm the text. Click the **"Cancel"** link at the bottom to dismiss the dialog without removing the Test Pilot add-on and all your active experiments (we'll verify this below).

1. Quickly verify that the data looks right-ish. Note that each environment (dev, stage, prod) has different content and descriptions, versions, contributors may all be wildly different between server environments.

1. Scroll down the page and verify that the experiment name and Enable/Disable buttons are "sticky".

1. Assuming the currently visible experiment is NOT active, click the **"Your privacy"** link up in the sticky header area.

1. Verify that the **"Your privacy"** section is briefly highlighted and fades out after a couple seconds.

1. Click the link in the **"Your privacy"** section to view the experiment's data collection policy (make sure it doesn't 404, and is readable and now just raw Markdown).

1. Click the Test Pilot icon in the toolbar and verify that the currently active experiment is listed as **"{Experiment name} is enabled."** and has a green checkbox.

1. Click the **"View all experiments"** button in the Test Pilot doorhanger and verify that you're taken to the https://testpilot.dev.mozaws.net/experiments page and your currently active experiments have a green outline (with a checkbox), and the button at the bottom of the experiment card has a gray **"Manage"** button instead of a blue **"Get Started"** button.

1. Select a new (non-active) experiment from the Test Pilot toolbar doorhanger, and click the blue **"Enable {experiment name}"** button from the experiment details page.

1. Click the Test Pilot icon in the toolbar and verify that both active experiments are listed as **"{Experiment name} is enabled."**.

1. Go back to the original Test Pilot experiment details page and click the gray **"Disable {experiment name}"** button. Verify that the number of active experiment users decreases by 1.

1. Verify that you see a **"Thank You!"** modal dialog which has an icon and thanks the user for their participation, and has two buttons:
    - a blue **"Take a quick survey"** button
    - a **"Close"** link

1. Leave some feedback, or close the newly opened tab.

1. Return to the recently deactivated experiment details page and verify that the experiment is no longer enabled and you see a blue **"Enable {experiment name}"** button, and clicking the Test Pilot button in the toolbar no longer lists the experiment as active.

1. Make sure you have at least ONE active experiment and click the **Settings** button in the header area.

1. Click the **"Uninstall Test Pilot"** link in the pop-up menu.

1. Verify that you're prompted to uninstall test pilot and given the option of proceeding (a big, scary red button), or cancelling (a non-threatening blue link). Clicking the Cancel button takes you back to safety. Clicking the scary red button will uninstall the Test Pilot add-on and any experiments you have currently installed.

1. Click the red **"Proceed"** button to leave the Test Pilot program. You should see a **"Shutting down"** spinner and then a **"Thanks for flying!"** modal dialog thanking you for your participaction and prompting you to **"Take a quick survey"** or returning to the Home page.

1. Click the blue **"Take a quick survey"** and you should be redirected to a Survey Gizmo page in a new tab. Leave some feedback or close the tab.

1. Click the **"Home"** link.

1. You should be back a the https://testpilot.dev.mozaws.net/ page and no longer be signed in. Verify that you no longer see the Test Pilot icon in the toolbar.

1. Go to **about:addons** and verify that you have no add-ons installed in the Extensions tab.
    - If you previously had the **Activity Stream** experiment installed and active, clicking "New Tab" should no longer show the Activity Stream experiment or beautiful new tab page.
    - If you previously had the **Tab Center** add-on installed and active, your side tabs should have reverted back to the top, as they were before you installed the experiment.
    - If you previously had the **Universal Search** add-on installed and active, your Awesome Bar search behavior should have reverted back to its previous, default behavior.
