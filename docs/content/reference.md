Experiment content is managed with a series of YAML files in the `content-src` directory. At build time, the YAML is converted to JSON, which the website loads at runtime.


# New experiments

To make a new experiment:

1. Copy the `template.yaml` file below into `./content-src/experiments`
2. Rename your file to match the eventual slug of your experiment eg `tab-center.yaml`
3. You'll need a place to put image assets for your experiment. Make a new directory './frontend/src/images/experiments' to match the name of your yaml file
4. In the directory you've created, `mkdir details social avatars tour icon`. You'll put various image assets into these folders.
5. As you add images, please compress them. You can do this with an [app](https://imageoptim.com/mac) or [command line tool](https://www.npmjs.com/package/image-min).
6. Populate the content as appropriate, using the [reference](#reference) to help.


# Localization

An experiment's YAML file is considered to contain the canonical localization for English. This content must be extracted & compiled into [an FTL file](https://testpilot.dev.mozaws.net/static/locales/en-US/experiments.ftl). That file is monitored by Pontoon, and strings are translated by volunteer localizers.

To manually extract strings for Pontoon, run the command `npm run l10n:extract`. If you have a dev server running via `npm start`, this should happen automatically when you change YAML files. In either case, the FTL file should *not* be edited manually.

Be sure to include changes to `locales/en-US/experiments.ftl` in your pull requests with changed content. The `npm run l10n:check` command will be run in CircleCI to help ensure any string changes have been picked up - uncommitted string changes will cause the test run to fail.

If a new field is added to the experiment YAML - and it needs to be localized - that field **must** be also added to [the list of `LOCALIZABLE_FIELDS` in `frontend/tasks/util.js`][LOCALIZABLE_FIELDS].

[LOCALIZABLE_FIELDS]: https://github.com/mozilla/testpilot/blob/master/frontend/tasks/util.js#L1

If the content of a string changes sufficiently that translations of it should be invalidated:

1. Make sure that this change needs to be done. We rely on volunteer localizers,
2. If at all possible, wait to make the change until the beginning of a sprint to give localizers time to translate the new string before the next deployment.
3. Add a new field to the YAML titled `<fieldname>_l10nsuffix`, set to a short string contextualizing the change.

For example: if we decide to rename the "Activity Streams" experiment to "Activity Stream", the following YAML:

```yaml
title: 'Activity Streams'
```

Would be changed to this:

```yaml
title: 'Activity Stream'
title_l10nsuffix: 'singular'
```

This change will turn the `l10n-id` from `activitystreamTitle` to `activitystreamTitleSingular`, treating it as an entirely new string and invalidating all existing translations.

This also works for nested properties:

```yaml
contributors:
  -
      display_name: 'Jared Hirsch'
      title: 'Staff Engineer'
      title_l10nsuffix: 'staff'

```
